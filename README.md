# Online Shopping Platform

**Duration:** September 2024 â€“ December 2024  
**Technologies:** Java, SQL, Spring Boot (optional), RESTful APIs, Azure, Jenkins, JUnit  

## Project Overview
This project is a scalable grocery e-commerce platform that enables users to browse products, add items to a shopping cart, and complete checkout workflows. The platform is designed with a service-oriented architecture to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

## Features
- **Real-time Product Browsing:** Users can view products with live updates and availability information.
- **Shopping Cart Management:** Items can be added, removed, and synchronized across sessions.
- **Checkout Workflow:** Secure checkout process integrated with backend services.
- **Automated Testing:** Unit tests using JUnit with over 95% coverage, ensuring reliability of backend services.
- **CI/CD Automation:** Jenkins pipelines configured for automated building, testing, and deployment to Azure cloud services.
- **Efficient Algorithms:** Implementation of core data structures and algorithms in Java (hash maps, arrays, sorting) for inventory search, cart logic, and order validation.

## Technical Highlights
- **Backend:** Developed using Java with RESTful APIs, enabling smooth communication between services.
- **Database:** SQL used to persist product, cart, and order data reliably.
- **Cloud Deployment:** Automated provisioning and deployment of backend services on Azure.
- **Testing:** JUnit used for rigorous unit testing to maintain high code quality.
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins pipelines enable continuous integration and deployment, reducing manual overhead and deployment errors.
